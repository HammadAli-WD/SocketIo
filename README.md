# SocketIo
/*
    Chat
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Today you'll be working on the chat.
    The chat will be a 1 to 1 chat with the other users in the platform.
    You'll be using Socket.io to handle the requests.
    Start from m7-d7 homework project (chat FE), you don't have a working one you can start from this frontend from Stefano Miceli: https://github.com/Strive-School-Apr20/m7-d7-socket_io-Homework_explaination **
    Try to realize an appropriate backend that includes:
    - private messages
    - broadcast messages
    - list of connected users
    [Extra] save messages in a Mongo collection and fetch them from FE
    ** since this FE has been realized during a debrief probably it could have some issues here and there feel free to fix them ;)
